# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**A molecular mathematical model of glucose mobilization and uptake.**   
Liu W, Hsin C, Tang F. _Math Biosci._ 2009 Oct;221(2):121-9.
[19651146](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19651146) ,  
**Abstract:**   
A new molecular mathematical model is developed by considering the kinetics of
GLUT2, GLUT3, and GLUT4, the process of glucose mobilization by glycogen
phosphorylase and glycogen synthase in liver, and the dynamics of the insulin
signaling pathway. The new model can qualitatively reproduce the experimental
glucose and insulin data. It also enables us to use the Bendixson criterion
about the existence of periodic orbits of a two-dimensional dynamical system
to mathematically predict that the oscillations of glucose and insulin are not
caused by liver, instead they would be caused by the mechanism of insulin
secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Furthermore it enables us to conduct a
parametric sensitivity analysis. The analysis shows that both glucose and
insulin are most sensitive to the rate constant for conversion of
PI(3,4,5)P(3) to PI(4,5)P(2), the multiplicative factor modulating the rate
constant for conversion of PI(3,4,5)P(3) to PI(4,5)P(2), the multiplicative
factor that modulates insulin receptor dephosphorylation rate, and the maximum
velocity of GLUT4. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis predicts that an
increase of the apparent velocity of GLUT4, a combination of elevated
mobilization rate of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and an extended duration of
GLUT4 on the plasma membrane, will result in a decrease in the needs of plasma
insulin. On the other hand, an increase of the GLUT4 internalization rate
results in an elevated demand of insulin to stimulate the mobilization of
GLUT4 from the intracellular store to the plasma membrane.
